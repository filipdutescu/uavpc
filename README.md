# UAVPC - Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Pose-based Control 

TODO

## Features

TODO

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local
machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

TODO

* **CMake v3.15+** - found at [https://cmake.org/](https://cmake.org/)

* **C++ Compiler** - needs to support at least the **C++17** standard, i.e. *MSVC*,
*GCC*, *Clang*

> ***Note:*** *You also need to be able to provide ***CMake*** a supported
[generator](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html).*

### Installing

It is fairly easy to install the project, all you need to do is clone if from
[GitHub](https://github.com/filipdutescu/uavpc).

If you wish to clone the repository, rather than generate from it, you simply need
to run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/filipdutescu/uavpc.git
```

TODO

To install an already built project, you need to run the `install` target with CMake.
For example:

```bash
cmake --build build --target install --config Release

# a more general syntax for that command is:
cmake --build <build_directory> --target install --config <desired_config>
```

## Building the project

To build the project, all you need to do, ***after correctly
[installing the project](README.md#Installing)***, is run a similar **CMake** routine
to the the one below:

```bash
mkdir build/ && cd build/
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/absolute/path/to/custom/install/directory
cmake --build . --target install
```

> ***Note:*** *The custom ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` can be omitted if you wish to
install in [the default install location](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/GNUInstallDirs.html).*

## Generating the documentation

In order to generate documentation for the project, you need to configure the build
to use Doxygen. This is easily done, by modifying the workflow shown above as follows:

```bash
mkdir build/ && cd build/
cmake .. -D<project_name>_ENABLE_DOXYGEN=1 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/absolute/path/to/custom/install/directory
cmake --build . --target doxygen-docs
```

> ***Note:*** *This will generate a `docs/` directory in the **project's root directory**.*

## Running the tests

By default, the template uses [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest/)
for unit testing. Unit testing can be disabled in the options, by setting the
`ENABLE_UNIT_TESTING` (from
[cmake/StandardSettings.cmake](cmake/StandardSettings.cmake)) to be false. To run
the tests, simply use CTest, from the build directory, passing the desire
configuration for which to run tests for. An example of this procedure is:

```bash
cd build          # if not in the build directory already
ctest -C Release  # or `ctest -C Debug` or any other configuration you wish to test

# you can also run tests with the `-VV` flag for a more verbose output (i.e.
#GoogleTest output as well)
```
